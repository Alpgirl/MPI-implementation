# MPI-implementation
MPI-implementation contains code on practicing parallel programming in miscellaneous ways.

Total:

ABC_dialog: message passing between 3 people.

Integral: solving an integral using MPI_Scatter and without

Linear_temp_eq: 

              2 tasks: 
              
              - hot rectangle in cold rectangle
              
              - stick with different temperatures on all sides
              
              Notes:
              
              - realised block and ribbon decompositon
              
              - realised possibility to launch on any amount of processes

openmp: solving an integral using OpenMP technology 

              Notes:
              
              - realised with section critical
              
              - realised with reduction
              
Send_vector_datatype: practicing passing a vector type data.
